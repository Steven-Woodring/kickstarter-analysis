# An analysis of Kickstarter fundraiser data
### Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to aid in the successful launch of a new theatrical project

## Overview of Project
### This analysis of Kickstarter data provides insights into the best fundraising strategies. Specifically, the analysis focused on former fundraising efforts for both theaters and plays, as our fictional client Louise is hoping to raise enough money to put on her own show, Fever. The analysis seeks to identify which month is best to launch a Kickstarter campaign and how the loftiness of the fundraising goal effects its success.

## Analysis and Challenges
### To begin the analysis of how different launch dates influenced the success of a fundraising campaign, I had to create a pivot table from the Kickstarter data that showed campaign outcomes (successful, failed, canceled) based on launch month. With my limited pivot table experience, it was challenging to figure out where to place each field. However, due to my practice in class and throughout the modules, I was able to determine that outcomes had to be assigned to both the columns and values where it would automatically be converted to a count. Additionally, I assigned my Date Created Conversion field to the rows and had to ensure that I got rid of the automatically generated Years and Quarters fields.<img width="296" alt="Screen Shot 2021-12-19 at 9 50 11 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95303422/146705848-6e72dd76-f37a-4752-8ef6-55ca81defbeb.png">
### Next, I filtered out the active campaigns from the table and used the Parent Category field to filter on only theater fundraisers. Finally, I sorted the pivot table to display the count of successful efforts in the first column. With these fields and filters in place, my pivot table was now accurately displaying the number of successful, failed, and canceled theater fundraising campaigns for each month. Having built a robust pivot table, I then made a line pivot chart to aid in the visualization of the analyzed data.
### With a better understanding of how launch month has influenced the success of former theater Kickstarter fundraisers, I moved on to an analysis of how the loftiness of the fundraising goal effects its success. I first grouped the monetary goals of the campaigns into 12 ranges. With these ranges set, I utilized the COUNTIFS() function to determine the number of successful, failed, and canceled play fundraisers. I am familiar with this function, but it took me a second to remember how to correctly use it. On top of this, I had never incorporated inequalities into a COUNTIFS() function and was unaware that they required quotation marks, and so I had to consult Stack Overflow before creating my first valid function:  <img width="728" alt="Screen Shot 2021-12-19 at 9 49 17 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95303422/146705890-97958a3e-8438-4b60-ba76-b0756119670a.png">
### Next, it was just a matter of slightly tweaking this formula to produce accurate values for every cell in my makeshift table, a process that could present a time challenge if it needed to be applied to a larger table. By summing these values, I was able to determine how many total projects there were for each goal range and calculate what percentage in each dollar range were successful, failed, and canceled. It turns out that there were no canceled fundraisers at all within the subcategory of plays. Creating a line chart provided a valuable visualization of which goal ranges have been more successful than not. Specifically, campaigns with fundraising goals of less than $15,000 have historically been more likely than not to raise the full amount. Projects that only asked for less than $5,000 met their goals about 75% of the time, with this success rate dipping to around 55% if they set their goal to more than $5,000 but less than $15,000. Surprisingly, goals between $35,000 and $45,000 have succeeded at over a 65% clip, although this sample is too small to be significant as only 9 plays set a goal in this range compared to 961 plays that sought to raise less than $15,000.

## Results
### In terms of setting a launch data, it is easy to see that Louise should target May to start her fundraiser. While the number of failed campaigns only jumped 30% from April to May, the number of successful projects increased more than 56%. June would also be an acceptable starting point, but Louise would not want to delay much later into the year. 
### Ideally, Louise would want to set her fundraising goal for less than $5,000, as this is the most popular and successful range for plays on Kickstarter. While the $35,000 - $45,000 range also has a history of success, the small sample size of fundraisers in this category make the results unreliable.
### The dataset is limited in that there may be other factors that affected the success of the fundraisers such as popularity of the creator. Additionally, the geography of the campaigns could be further broken down into state/region. It is possible, for example, that fundraisers in New York state have an easier time reaching their goal than fundraisers in, say, Arizona.
### Further analysis could include a detailed look into the average donation that projects received. I would like to analyze if factors like start date or category influence the average amount each backer is inclined to donate.
